<h1>Compute Grid Resources</h1>

<p>Compute Grid is a peer-to-peer GPU Resource Marketplace offering inexpensive and fully virtualized GPU instances.</p>
<p>We also pride ourselves in being easy to use and beginner friendly. One of the ways we do that is by offering public resources, such as this one.</p>
